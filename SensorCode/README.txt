This is the final Atmel Studio project used for the sEMG-MMD sensors. 
This version consists of the original code following the adjustment to offset I2C transactions and EMG sensor reads, preventing the interference observed when these occur simultaneously. 

The project was generated using the Atmel Start toolset, and contains the files to permit editing via this toolset. All config, setup, and driver files are auto-generated by the toolset. 

Files containing user generated code for the sensors are: main.c, MAX30205(.c/.h), and AD5933(.c/.h).
